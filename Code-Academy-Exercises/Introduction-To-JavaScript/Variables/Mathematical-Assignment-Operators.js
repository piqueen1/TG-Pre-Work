//5. Mathematical Assignment Operators
let molecule = 16;
let particle = 18;
let assay = 3;
// Add and assign to molecule below
molecule += 16;
// Multiply and assign to particle below
particle *= 6.02;
// Increment assay by 1
assay++

// We also have access to other mathematical assignment operators: -=, *=, and /= which work in a similar fashion.
