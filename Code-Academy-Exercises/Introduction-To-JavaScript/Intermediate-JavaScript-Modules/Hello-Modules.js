/* By separating code with similar logic into files called modules, we can:

find, fix, and debug code more easily;
reuse and recycle defined logic in different parts of our application;
keep information private and protected from other modules;
and, importantly, prevent pollution of the global namespace and potential naming collisions, by cautiously selecting variables and behavior we load into a program.
