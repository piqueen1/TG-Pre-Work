/* To load fonts with the @font-face property:

Instead of using the font's link in the HTML document, enter the link into the URL bar in the browser.
The browser will load the CSS rules. You will need to focus on the rules that are directly labeled as latin . Some of the latin rules are on separate lines. You will need each of these.
Copy each of the CSS rules labeled latin, and paste the rules from the browser to the top of style.css.
